The neighbors of room_3 are rooms 4, 2, 5, 7 and objects 13, 14, 38, 47. \n\nLooking at the categories of the neighboring rooms, room_4 is a bedroom, room_2 is a bathroom, room_5 is a corridor, and room_7 is a kitchen. \n\nCups are typically found in kitchens, but room_7 (the kitchen) is not directly connected to the current room (room_3). Therefore, it would be inefficient to go to room_7 directly. \n\nOn the other hand, room_5 is a corridor, which is often a transitional space connecting different rooms. Going to room_5 could potentially provide access to more rooms, increasing the chances of finding a kitchen where a cup might be located. \n\nThe objects in the current room (objects 13, 14, 38, 47) are books, a chair, and a bed, none of which are cups. \n\nTherefore, the best choice would be to go to room_5, as it could potentially lead to more rooms and increase the chances of finding a cup.\n\n{'choice': 'room_5'}"
