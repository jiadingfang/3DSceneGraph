The neighbors are room_19 (another storage room), room_6 (a corridor), room_7 (another corridor), room_18 (a staircase), and object_18 (a bench).\n\nThe object we are looking for, a refrigerator, is most likely to be found in a storage room rather than a corridor or on a staircase. Therefore, we can eliminate room_6, room_7, and room_18 from our choices. Object_18 is a bench, which is not what we are looking for, so we can also eliminate this option.\n\nThis leaves us with room_19, which is another storage room. Since refrigerators are often found in storage rooms, this is the most logical choice. Additionally, we have not visited room_19 before, so it is a new area to explore.\n\nTherefore, the next place to go should be room_19. \n\n{'choice': 'room_19'}"
