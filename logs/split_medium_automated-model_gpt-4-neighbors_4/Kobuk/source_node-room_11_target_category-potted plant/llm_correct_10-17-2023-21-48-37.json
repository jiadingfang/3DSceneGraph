        "content": "The current task is to find an object in the category 'potted plant'. The current location is room_9, which is a dining room. The objects in this room are a dining table and two chairs, none of which are the target object. \n\nLooking at the neighboring rooms, room_11 is an empty room, room_15 is a kitchen, room_18 is a staircase, and room_7 is a corridor. \n\nPotted plants are typically used for decoration and are often found in living spaces rather than functional spaces like kitchens or empty rooms. Therefore, the chances of finding a potted plant in room_11 (empty room) or room_15 (kitchen) are relatively low.\n\nBetween room_18 (staircase) and room_7 (corridor), potted plants are more likely to be found in staircases as they are often used to enhance the aesthetics of such spaces. Corridors, on the other hand, are typically used for transit and may not have decorative items like potted plants.\n\nTherefore, the next place to go should be room_18.\n\n{'choice': 'room_18'}"
