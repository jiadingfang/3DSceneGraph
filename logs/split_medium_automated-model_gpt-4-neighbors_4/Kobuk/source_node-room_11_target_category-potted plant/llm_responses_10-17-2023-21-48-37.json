We've visited 'room_6' and 'room_7', so we can remove them from our options. \n\nNext, we can eliminate 'object_24' because it's a couch, not a potted plant. \n\nThis leaves us with 'room_2' and 'room_1'. Both are bathrooms, which are less likely to have a potted plant compared to other room types. However, since we have no other information to make a decision, we can choose either of them. \n\nLet's choose 'room_2' because it's on a different floor ('B' instead of 'A'), which might give us new areas to explore.\n\nSo, the next place to go is 'room_2'.\n\n{'choice': 'room_2'}"
