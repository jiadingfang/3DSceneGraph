This could potentially mean that 'room_13' is in a different area of the building which we have not explored yet, increasing the chances of finding the 'chair' object.\n\nAdditionally, 'room_13' has the largest floor area and volume among the options, which could mean it contains more objects, thus increasing the probability of finding a 'chair'.\n\nTherefore, the next place to go should be 'room_13'.\n\n{'choice': 'room_13'}"
