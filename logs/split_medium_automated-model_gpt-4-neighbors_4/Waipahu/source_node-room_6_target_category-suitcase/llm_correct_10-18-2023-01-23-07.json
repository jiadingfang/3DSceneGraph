Among the neighboring rooms, room_11 and room_8 are on floor 'A', while room_2 and room_4 are on the same floor 'B'. \n\nIf we consider the floor number, moving to a different floor might involve stairs or elevators, which could potentially increase the travel time. However, we don't have enough information to make a decision based on this factor alone.\n\nLooking at the scene categories of the neighboring rooms, room_11 is a 'staircase', room_2 is a 'bathroom', room_4 is a 'bedroom', and room_8 is a 'kitchen'. Suitcases are typically not found in bathrooms or kitchens, so we can likely rule out room_2 and room_8. Between a 'staircase' and a 'bedroom', a 'bedroom' might be a more likely place to find a suitcase, but again, this is not a definitive factor.\n\nConsidering the volume of the rooms, room_11 has the smallest volume, which could potentially mean less area to search. However, this is also not a definitive factor.\n\nGiven the lack of definitive information, we might choose room_11 as the next place to visit because it is on a different floor and has a smaller volume, which could potentially mean less area to search. However, this decision is based on assumptions and may not guarantee finding the suitcase.\n\n{'choice"
