However, we can make an educated guess based on the 'scene_category' of each room. \n\nThe options are 'staircase', 'corridor', and 'bedroom'. Toilets are usually not found in staircases or corridors, but they are often attached to bedrooms. Therefore, the best choice would be to check the bedrooms first. \n\nAmong the two bedrooms, room_3 and room_4, we can choose based on their proximity to the current location. However, since we don't have the exact distances, we can choose either. \n\nTherefore, the choice should be room_3. \n\n{'choice': 'room_3'}"
