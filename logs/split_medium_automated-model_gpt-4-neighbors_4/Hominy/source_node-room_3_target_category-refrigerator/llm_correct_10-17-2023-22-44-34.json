Room_7 and room_5 are on floor 'A' and 'B' respectively, but their scene categories are 'empty_room' and 'corridor', which are less likely to contain a refrigerator compared to a typical room. \n\nOn the other hand, room_8 is on the same floor 'B' as the current room, and its scene category is 'empty_room', which might have a higher chance of containing a refrigerator. Moreover, it has a larger volume than room_5, indicating it's a larger space and could potentially contain more objects, increasing the chance of finding a refrigerator. \n\nTherefore, the next place to go should be room_8.\n\n{'choice': 'room_8'}"
