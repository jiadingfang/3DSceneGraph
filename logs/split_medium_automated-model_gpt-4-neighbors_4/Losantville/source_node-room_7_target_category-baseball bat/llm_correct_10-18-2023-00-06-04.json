        "content": "The current task is to find an object in the category 'baseball bat' with the shortest path possible. The current location is room_17, and the neighboring locations are room_26, room_27, room_14, room_5, and object_78. \n\nLooking at the information of the neighboring locations, none of them contain the object 'baseball bat'. Therefore, the decision should be based on other factors that might lead to the object. \n\nRoom_26 is on floor 'A', which is a different floor from the current location (floor 'B'). Changing floors might increase the chances of finding the object. Also, room_26 is a 'staircase', which could potentially connect to more rooms and increase the chances of finding the object. \n\nOn the other hand, room_27 is also a 'staircase' but it's on the same floor ('B') as the current location. Room_14 is a 'corridor' on floor 'A', and room_5 is a 'bathroom' on floor 'C'. The object 'baseball bat' is less likely to be found in a 'bathroom'. \n\nObject_78 is a 'refrigerator', which is not the target object. \n\nTherefore, considering the factors of floor number and room type, room_26 seems to be the most promising choice for the next location to visit.\n\n{'choice': 'room_26'}"
