Since we are currently on floor 'A', it would be more efficient to stay on the same floor. \n\nBetween 'room_1' and 'room_12', 'room_1' has a smaller volume (5.22) compared to 'room_12' (19.13). This means that 'room_1' is smaller and thus, it would take less time to search for the 'potted plant' in 'room_1'. \n\nTherefore, the best choice would be 'room_1'. \n\n{'choice': 'room_1'}"
