        "content": "Looking at the information provided, we can see that all the rooms are on the same building and have different types. The 'banana' object we are looking for is likely to be found in a room where food is stored or consumed. However, none of the rooms provided are of such type. \n\nTherefore, we need to make a decision based on other factors. One of these factors could be the floor number. Since the current room is on floor 'C', it might be beneficial to stay on the same floor to minimize vertical movement. Among the options, 'room_2' and 'room_5' are on the same floor 'C'.\n\nAnother factor could be the size of the room. Smaller rooms might be quicker to search through. Among 'room_2' and 'room_5', 'room_5' has a smaller floor area and volume.\n\nTherefore, considering these factors, 'room_5' seems to be the best choice.\n\n{'choice': 'room_5'}"
