Therefore, we need to move to a different type of room.\n\nLooking at the neighboring rooms, we have:\n\n1. room_16, which is a lobby. While it's possible to find a dining table in a lobby, it's not the most likely place.\n2. room_7, which is a corridor. Dining tables are not typically found in corridors.\n3. room_8, which is another corridor. However, it's on a different floor (floor B), which might increase the chances of finding a dining table if we assume that dining tables are more likely to be found on higher floors.\n4. room_18, which is another staircase. As mentioned before, it's unlikely to find a dining table in a staircase.\n\nTherefore, the best choice seems to be room_8. It's on a different floor, which might increase the chances of finding a dining table. Also, by choosing room_8, we are not revisiting any previously visited rooms, which would be inefficient.\n\n{'choice': 'room_8'}"
