Among the neighboring locations, there are four rooms and two objects, none of which are a refrigerator. \n\nThe choice should be room_12 for the following reasons:\n\n1. Room_12 is on the same floor ('B') as the current room (room_11). This could potentially minimize the path length as we don't need to change floors.\n\n2. Room_12 is an 'empty_room' which might indicate that it is a kitchen or a storage room where a refrigerator could be located.\n\n3. Room_12 has a larger volume (41.33) compared to other rooms. A larger room might have more objects, increasing the chance of finding a refrigerator.\n\n4. The other rooms are a 'living_room' and a 'lobby', which are less likely to contain a refrigerator compared to an 'empty_room'.\n\nTherefore, the next place to go should be room_12.\n\n{'choice': 'room_12'}"
