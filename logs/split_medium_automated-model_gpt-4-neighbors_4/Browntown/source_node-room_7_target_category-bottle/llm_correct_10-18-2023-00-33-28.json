However, there are no objects in the category 'bottle' in this room. The neighbors of room_1 are rooms 8, 20, 7, 9, and objects 50, 89, 105. \n\nLooking at the neighbors, room_7 can be eliminated from consideration because it has already been visited. The objects 50, 89, 105 are a potted plant, a toilet, and a sink respectively, none of which are in the category 'bottle'. \n\nThis leaves rooms 8, 20, and 9. Room_8 is a corridor, and room_9 is also a corridor. Corridors are less likely to contain a 'bottle' compared to other types of rooms. \n\nOn the other hand, room_20 is a lobby. Lobbies often contain various types of objects and have a higher chance of containing a 'bottle'. Furthermore, room_20 has a larger floor area and volume compared to the other rooms, which means it likely contains more objects. \n\nTherefore, the best choice would be to go to room_20 next. \n\n{'choice': 'room_20'}"
