Among the neighboring rooms, room_7 is a corridor, room_16 is another staircase, room_10 is a garage, and room_12 is a living room. \n\nAlthough a cup could potentially be found in a living room, the living room is on floor 'B', which means it would require going up a floor. This could potentially lengthen the path. \n\nOn the other hand, room_10 is a garage, which is on the same floor 'A' as the current location. Garages often have storage areas where a cup might be found. Therefore, it could be a shorter path to check room_10 first.\n\nSo, the choice should be room_10. \n\n{'choice': 'room_10'}"
