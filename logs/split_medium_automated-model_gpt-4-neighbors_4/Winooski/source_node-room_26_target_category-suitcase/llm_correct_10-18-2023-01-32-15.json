Room_10 and Room_9 are both corridors, which are also less likely to contain a suitcase.\n3. Room_30 is a staircase, which is not a typical place to find a suitcase.\n4. Room_13 is another corridor, but it has the largest floor area among the options. \n\nGiven that a suitcase is typically found in larger, more trafficked areas, the larger corridor (Room_13) might be the best option. \n\nTherefore, the choice should be Room_13.\n\n{'choice': 'room_13'}"
