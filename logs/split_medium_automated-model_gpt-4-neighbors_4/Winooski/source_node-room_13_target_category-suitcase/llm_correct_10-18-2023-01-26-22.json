Room_19: This room is an 'exercise_room' which might have a higher chance of having a 'suitcase' as people often bring personal belongings to such places.\n3. Room_18: This room is a 'dining_room', which is less likely to have a 'suitcase'.\n4. Room_15: This room is a 'corridor', which is also less likely to have a 'suitcase'.\n\nTherefore, based on the type of rooms and the likelihood of finding a 'suitcase', room_19 seems to be the best choice.\n\n{'choice': 'room_19'}"
