However, the goal is to find the shortest path. \n\nRoom_31 is the closest to the current location based on the location array values. Although it's a staircase and might not typically have a potted plant, it could potentially be a quicker route to other rooms that do. \n\nTherefore, the choice should be room_31.\n\n{'choice': 'room_31'}"
