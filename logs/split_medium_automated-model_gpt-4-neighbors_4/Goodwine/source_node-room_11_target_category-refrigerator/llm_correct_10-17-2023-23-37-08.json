        "content": "Given the information provided, we can make a few assumptions to guide our choice:\n\n1. Refrigerators are typically not found in bathrooms or staircases, so we can likely rule out room_2, room_3, and room_19.\n2. Refrigerators are more likely to be found in a room that is not a bathroom or staircase, so room_14, an 'empty_room', is a more likely candidate.\n\nHowever, you asked specifically about room_2. Here's why it might not be the best choice:\n\n1. Room_2 is a bathroom, and refrigerators are not typically found in bathrooms.\n2. The volume and floor area of room_2 are smaller than room_14, which might suggest less likelihood of a refrigerator being present.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, room_2 does not seem to be the best choice for finding a refrigerator. However, if there are other factors to consider, such as the presence of a mini-fridge in a bathroom, the decision could change.\n\n{'choice': 'room_14'}"
