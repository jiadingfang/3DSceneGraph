However, there are no objects in the category 'apple' in this room. \n\nLooking at the neighboring locations, there are four rooms (room_9, room_1, room_2, room_3) and four objects (object_2, object_54, object_58, object_66). The objects are not in the category 'apple', so they can be disregarded.\n\nAmong the rooms, room_1 is on the same floor ('A') as the current room, which means it would likely take less time to reach compared to the rooms on floor 'B'. Also, room_1 is a bathroom, and while it's not common to find apples in a bathroom, it's still possible.\n\nTherefore, the next place to go should be room_1. This choice is based on the proximity (same floor) and the potential (though unlikely) possibility of finding an apple.\n\n{'choice': 'room_1'}"
