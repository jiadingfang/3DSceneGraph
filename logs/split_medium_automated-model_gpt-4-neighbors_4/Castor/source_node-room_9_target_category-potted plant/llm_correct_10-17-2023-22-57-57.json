Among the neighboring places, there are four rooms and one object, which is a surfboard. \n\nSince the surfboard is not the target object, it can be excluded. Among the remaining rooms, room_5 is a corridor. Corridors often connect multiple rooms, which means it could potentially lead to a room containing the target object. \n\nThe other rooms are either empty or a staircase, which are less likely to contain a potted plant. Therefore, the best choice would be to go to room_5.\n\n{'choice': 'room_5'}"
