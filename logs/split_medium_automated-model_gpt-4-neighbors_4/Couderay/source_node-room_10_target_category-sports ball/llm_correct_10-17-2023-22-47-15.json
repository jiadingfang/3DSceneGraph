Object_12 is a refrigerator, which does not fall into the 'sports ball' category we are looking for. Room_18 and room_20 are on the same floor ('B') as the current room (room_9), so it might be more efficient to explore a different floor to increase the chances of finding the object. Therefore, room_19, which is on a different floor ('A'), could be a good choice. \n\n{'choice': 'room_19'}"
