The neighbors are rooms 9, 8, 20, 13 and object 65. \n\nLooking at the categories of the neighboring rooms, room 9 and room 20 are a corridor and a staircase respectively, which are unlikely to contain an oven. Room 8 is also a corridor, and it's also on the same floor ('A') as the current room, so it's less likely to contain an oven. \n\nRoom 13, however, is a garage. While it's not common, some garages might contain an oven, especially if they've been converted into a living space. Therefore, it's more likely to find an oven in room 13 than in the other rooms. \n\nObject 65 is a bed, which is not the target object. \n\nTherefore, the next place to go should be room_13.\n\n{'choice': 'room_13'}"
