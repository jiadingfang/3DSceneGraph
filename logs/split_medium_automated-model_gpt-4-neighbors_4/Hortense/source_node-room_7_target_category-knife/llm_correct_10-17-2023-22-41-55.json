        "content": "The current location is room_7, which is on floor 'B'. The task is to find the shortest path to a 'knife' object. The information about the presence of a 'knife' in any of the rooms is not provided. Therefore, the decision should be based on the other available information.\n\nLooking at the neighboring rooms, room_1 and room_17 are also on floor 'B', while room_15 and room_16 are on floor 'A'. If we assume that the 'knife' is more likely to be found in a kitchen or dining area, these are typically located on the ground floor or floor 'A' in many building structures. Therefore, it might be more beneficial to move to a room on floor 'A'.\n\nBetween room_15 and room_16, both are on floor 'A', but room_15 is a 'lobby' and room_16 is a 'staircase'. A 'knife' is less likely to be found in a 'staircase', so room_15, being a 'lobby', might be a better choice.\n\nAlso, room_15 has a smaller volume than room_16, which could potentially mean less area to search for the 'knife'.\n\nTherefore, considering the floor level, the type of room, and the volume of the room, room_15 seems to be the most logical choice.\n\n{'choice': 'room_15'}"
