However, among the available options, there is no kitchen. The closest related room is the dining room (room_10), but it's on a different floor (floor 'B'), which might take more time to reach. \n\nOn the other hand, room_2 is a bathroom and it's on the same floor ('C') as the current room. Although it's not common, sometimes people do keep cups in the bathroom. Moreover, it's closer in terms of location coordinates compared to other rooms. \n\nTherefore, considering the shortest path possible and the possibility of finding a cup, room_2 seems to be a reasonable choice. \n\n{'choice': 'room_2'}"
