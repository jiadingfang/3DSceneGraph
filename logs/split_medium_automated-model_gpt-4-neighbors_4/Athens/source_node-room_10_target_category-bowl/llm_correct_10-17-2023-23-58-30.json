The neighbors are rooms 2, 1, 11, 13, and object 75. \n\nLooking at the information of the neighbors, none of them are a 'bowl'. Therefore, the decision should be based on the type of the rooms, as certain types of rooms are more likely to contain a 'bowl'. \n\nRoom_2 is a bathroom, room_1 is also a bathroom, room_11 is a corridor, and room_13 is a dining room. Among these, a dining room is more likely to contain a 'bowl'. However, room_13 is on the same floor as the current room (floor 'A'), while room_2 is on a different floor (floor 'B'). \n\nSince the environment is unknown, it might be beneficial to explore different floors to increase the chances of finding a 'bowl'. Therefore, room_2 could be a good choice. \n\nHowever, it's important to note that this decision is based on assumptions and might not lead to the shortest path to a 'bowl'. \n\n{'choice': 'room_2'}"
