However, considering the shortest path, it would be more efficient to check the closest rooms first before moving to farther ones. \n\nAmong the neighboring rooms, room_1 is the closest to the current location based on the location coordinates. Although it's a bathroom and it's unlikely to find a surfboard there, it's still worth checking due to its proximity. \n\nTherefore, the next place to go should be room_1.\n\n{'choice': 'room_1'}"
