The neighboring locations are rooms 4, 10, 1, 9, and object 28. \n\nObject 28 is a 'frisbee', not a 'vase', so it can be eliminated from consideration. \n\nRooms 4, 10, and 1 are all either 'bedroom', 'empty_room', or 'bathroom'. While it's possible a 'vase' could be found in any of these rooms, there's no specific information suggesting it would be more likely in one over the others.\n\nRoom 9, however, is also an 'empty_room'. The reason to choose room 9 over the others is its location. It's closer to the current location (room_8) than rooms 4, 10, and 1, as indicated by the location array values. This means the path to room 9 would be shorter, fulfilling the requirement to find the 'vase' with the shortest path possible.\n\nTherefore, the next place to go should be room_9.\n\n{'choice': 'room_9'}"
