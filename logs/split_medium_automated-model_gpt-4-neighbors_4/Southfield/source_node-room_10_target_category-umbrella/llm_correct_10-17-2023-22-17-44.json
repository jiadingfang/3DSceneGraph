        "content": "Given the information provided, we can make a decision based on the following factors:\n\n1. Room Type: Room_4 is a corridor, which typically connects multiple rooms. This could potentially lead to more options in the search for the umbrella.\n\n2. Floor Number: Room_4 is on floor 'A', which is a different floor from the current room (room_10 on floor 'B'). Exploring a different floor might increase the chances of finding the umbrella.\n\n3. Size and Volume: Room_4 has the smallest floor area and volume among the options. This means it would take less time to search this room compared to the others.\n\n4. Location: The location of Room_4 is relatively close to the current room (room_10), which could potentially reduce the travel time.\n\nBased on these factors, Room_4 seems to be a reasonable choice for the next place to visit in the search for the umbrella.\n\n{'choice': 'room_4'}"
