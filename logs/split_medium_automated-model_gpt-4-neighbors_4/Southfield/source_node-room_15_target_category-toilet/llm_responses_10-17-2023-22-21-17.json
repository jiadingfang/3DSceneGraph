'room_19' and 'room_16' are 'staircase' and 'lobby' respectively, which are less likely to contain a toilet. 'room_4' is a 'corridor', which might lead to a toilet, but it's not as likely as 'room_21' which is a 'storage' room. Storage rooms are often located near facilities like toilets for convenience.\n\nTherefore, the best choice would be 'room_21'.\n\n{'choice': 'room_21'}"
