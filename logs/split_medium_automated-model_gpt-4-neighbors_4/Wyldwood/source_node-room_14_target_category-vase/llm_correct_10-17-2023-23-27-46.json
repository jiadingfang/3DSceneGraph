The goal is to find the shortest path to a 'vase'. \n\nLooking at the neighboring rooms, room_7 and room_4 are on floor 'C', room_13 is on floor 'A', and room_11 is also on floor 'B'. \n\nSince the floor information of the 'vase' is not provided, we can't make a decision based on the floor number. \n\nHowever, considering the scene categories of the rooms, a 'vase' is more likely to be found in a 'corridor' (room_7) or a 'bedroom' (room_4) than in a 'staircase' (room_13) or a 'kitchen' (room_11). \n\nBetween room_7 and room_4, room_7 is closer to the current location (room_14) based on the location coordinates. Therefore, room_7 is the best choice for the next move.\n\n{'choice': 'room_7'}"
