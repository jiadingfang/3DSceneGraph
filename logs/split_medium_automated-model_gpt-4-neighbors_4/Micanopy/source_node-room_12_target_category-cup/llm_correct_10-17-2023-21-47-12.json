The goal is to find the shortest path to a 'cup'. \n\nLooking at the neighboring rooms, room_11 is on floor 'A', room_23 and room_21 are on the same floor 'B' as the current room, and room_22 is also on floor 'A' but at a negative location value which might indicate it's below the current level.\n\nSince the floor information of the 'cup' is not provided, we can't make a decision based on the floor level. However, considering the location values, room_11 has the highest location value among the neighbors which might indicate it's closer to the 'cup'. \n\nMoreover, room_11 has the smallest volume among the neighbors, which means it would take less time to search for the 'cup' in room_11 compared to the other rooms. \n\nTherefore, considering the location value and the volume of the room, room_11 seems to be the most promising choice for the next step.\n\n{'choice': 'room_11'}"
