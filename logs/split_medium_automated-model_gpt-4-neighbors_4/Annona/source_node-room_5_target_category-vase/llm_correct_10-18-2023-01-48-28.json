The neighboring rooms are room_1 (a bathroom), room_2 (another bathroom), room_16 (a storage room), and room_3 (another bedroom). \n\nBathrooms and storage rooms are less likely to contain a vase compared to a bedroom. Bedrooms are more likely to have decorative items such as vases. Therefore, room_3, being a bedroom, is a more probable location to find a vase. \n\nAlso, considering the floor numbers, room_3 is on the same floor ('B') as the current room (room_5), which could potentially make the path shorter compared to rooms on different floors.\n\nTherefore, the next place to go should be room_3.\n\n{'choice': 'room_3'}"
