Therefore, the choice should be based on the type of room that is most likely to contain a toilet. \n\nLooking at the neighboring rooms, we have a corridor (room_7), a closet (room_6), a kitchen (room_12), and a storage room (room_16). Among these, none is typically associated with a toilet. However, considering the size of the rooms, room_16 is the largest with a floor area of 28.76. Larger rooms are more likely to contain more objects, increasing the chance of finding a toilet. \n\nTherefore, the next place to go should be room_16.\n\n{'choice': 'room_16'}"
