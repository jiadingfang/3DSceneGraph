Vases are typically found in living areas such as dining rooms or bedrooms, rather than in kitchens or corridors. \n\nBetween the bedroom (room_4) and the dining room (room_9), the dining room is a more likely location for a vase, as vases are often used as centerpieces on dining tables. \n\nTherefore, the next place to go should be room_9.\n\n{'choice': 'room_9'}"
