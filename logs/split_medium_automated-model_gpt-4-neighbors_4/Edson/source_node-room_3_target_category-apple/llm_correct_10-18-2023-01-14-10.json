The objects in this room are a bottle, a potted plant, a toilet, and a sink, none of which are an apple. \n\nLooking at the neighboring rooms, room_3 and room_1 are also bathrooms, which are unlikely to contain an apple. Room_12 is a home office, which might contain an apple, but it's less likely than a dining area.\n\nRoom_11, however, is a dining room. Apples are typically found in areas related to food, such as a dining room. Therefore, it is reasonable to choose room_11 as the next place to visit in the search for an apple.\n\n{'choice': 'room_11'}"
