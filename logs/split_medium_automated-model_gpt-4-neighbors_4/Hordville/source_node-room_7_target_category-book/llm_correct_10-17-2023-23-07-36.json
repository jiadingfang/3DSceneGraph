Room_2 is a bathroom, which is also less likely to contain a book, but it's on a different floor (B) which we haven't explored yet.\n3. Room_6 is a child's room, which might contain a book, but it's on the same floor (C) as the current room.\n4. Room_17 is a staircase, which is least likely to contain a book.\n\nAlthough bathrooms are not typically where books are found, it might be worth exploring as it's on a different floor (B) which we haven't explored yet. This could potentially lead us to other rooms that might contain a book. Therefore, the choice should be room_2.\n\n{'choice': 'room_2'}"
