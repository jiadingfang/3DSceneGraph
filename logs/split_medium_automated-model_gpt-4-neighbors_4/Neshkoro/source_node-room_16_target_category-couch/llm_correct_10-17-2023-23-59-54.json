Therefore, we need to move to a neighboring room. \n\nLooking at the neighboring rooms, none of them contain the object 'couch'. However, we can make a decision based on other factors such as the type of room or the floor area. \n\nRoom_13 and room_24 are both on floor 'A', while room_15 and room_20 are on the same floor 'B' as the current room. Since changing floors might take more time, it would be more efficient to stay on the same floor. \n\nBetween room_15 and room_20, room_15 has a larger floor area (13.93) compared to room_20 (8.3). A larger room might have a higher probability of containing a couch. \n\nTherefore, the next place to go should be room_15.\n\n{'choice': 'room_15'}"
