However, considering the types of the neighboring rooms, a chair is more likely to be found in a room rather than with an object. \n\nAmong the rooms, room_2 is a bathroom, room_7 is a corridor, room_15 is a lobby, and room_17 is a utility room. Chairs are not typically found in bathrooms, corridors, or utility rooms. While a lobby (room_15) might have a chair, it's on the same floor ('B') as the current room and the bathroom (room_2), which could potentially reduce the travel distance if the chair isn't found in the lobby.\n\nTherefore, the next location to visit should be room_2. Even though it's a bathroom and not likely to contain a chair, it's on the same floor and could potentially reduce the overall travel distance. \n\n{'choice': 'room_2'}"
