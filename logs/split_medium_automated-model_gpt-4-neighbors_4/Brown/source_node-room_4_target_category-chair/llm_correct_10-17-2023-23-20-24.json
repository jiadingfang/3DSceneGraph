Therefore, the next step should be to move to another room.\n\nAmong the room options, 'room_3' is the closest one based on the location data. It is also on the same floor ('C') as the current room ('room_4'), which could potentially mean a shorter path. \n\nMoreover, 'room_3' is a 'bathroom' like the current room. Although bathrooms typically don't contain chairs, it's possible that this environment is different. However, without additional information about the likelihood of finding a chair in different room types, it's reasonable to choose the closest room.\n\nTherefore, the next place to go should be 'room_3'.\n\n{'choice': 'room_3'}"
