'room_17' and 'room_22' are both categorized as 'empty_room', which implies that they might not contain the object we are looking for. On the other hand, 'room_12' is a 'corridor', which might lead us to more rooms and increase our chances of finding a 'chair'. \n\nTherefore, 'room_12' seems to be the most promising choice. \n\n{'choice': 'room_12'}"
