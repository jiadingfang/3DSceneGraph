        "content": "The goal is to find an object in the category 'bottle' with the shortest path possible. Currently, we are in room_24 which is an empty room. The neighboring rooms are room_27, room_15, room_35, and room_34. \n\nLooking at the information of each room, room_27 and room_35 are on the same floor 'C' as the current room, while room_15 and room_34 are on different floors 'B' and 'D'. Since changing floors might involve more time and distance, it would be more efficient to stay on the same floor first.\n\nAmong the rooms on the same floor, room_27 is an empty room and room_35 is a staircase. Staircases are less likely to contain a 'bottle' as they are not typically places where people would leave objects. On the other hand, even though room_27 is an empty room, it still has a higher chance of containing a 'bottle' than a staircase.\n\nTherefore, the next place to go should be room_27. \n\n{'choice': 'room_27'}"
