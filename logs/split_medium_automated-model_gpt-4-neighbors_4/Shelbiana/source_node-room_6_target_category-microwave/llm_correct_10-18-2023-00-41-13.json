Among the neighboring rooms, room_10 and room_7 are categorized as 'empty_room', and room_2 is a 'bathroom'. Therefore, these rooms are less likely to contain a microwave. \n\nOn the other hand, room_4 is categorized as a 'corridor'. Corridors often lead to or are connected with common areas or kitchens where a microwave might be found. Therefore, it would be a strategic choice to go to room_4 next, as it might lead us closer to our target object.\n\n{'choice': 'room_4'}"
