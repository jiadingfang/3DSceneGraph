Therefore, the choice of the next room to visit should be based on other factors. \n\nLooking at the information provided, room_2 is the closest room to the current location (room_10) based on the location array values. This could potentially lead to a shorter path in the overall search for the 'chair' object. \n\nAdditionally, room_2 is a 'bathroom' which might contain a chair or similar seating object. Although it's not the most common place to find a chair, it's still possible.\n\nTherefore, considering the proximity and the potential of finding a chair, room_2 seems to be a reasonable choice for the next place to visit.\n\n{'choice': 'room_2'}"
