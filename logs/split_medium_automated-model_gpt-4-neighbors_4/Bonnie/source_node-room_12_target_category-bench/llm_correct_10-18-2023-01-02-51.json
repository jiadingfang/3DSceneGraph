However, we can make an educated guess based on the types of rooms available. \n\nThe options are a utility room (room_25), a television room (room_23), a dining room (room_14), and a kitchen (room_18). \n\nBenches are typically not found in kitchens or television rooms. While it's possible a bench could be in a dining room, it's more likely to be in a utility room, as utility rooms often have benches for various purposes.\n\nTherefore, the best choice based on the given information would be to go to room_25, the utility room.\n\n{'choice': 'room_25'}"
