Looking at the neighboring rooms, we have a bedroom (room_7), a corridor (room_12), a kitchen (room_18), and another bedroom (room_8). TVs are not typically found in kitchens or corridors, but they can be found in bedrooms. However, considering the shortest path, it would be more efficient to first explore the corridor (room_12) as it might lead to other rooms such as a living room where a TV is more likely to be found. Therefore, the next place to go should be room_12.\n\n{'choice': 'room_12'}"
