The current location is room_8 and the neighbors are room_15, room_16, room_7, room_13, and object_46. \n\nLooking at the information of the neighbors, none of them contain the object 'suitcase'. Therefore, the decision should be based on other factors such as the type of the room, the floor area, and the volume. \n\nRoom_16 is a staircase which could potentially lead to other rooms or floors where the suitcase might be located. Also, it has a larger floor area and volume compared to room_15 and room_7, which might increase the chance of finding the suitcase. Room_13 is a living room which might also contain the suitcase, but it's on the same floor as the current room (room_8), so it might be more efficient to explore other floors first. \n\nTherefore, the next place to go should be room_16.\n\n{'choice': 'room_16'}"
