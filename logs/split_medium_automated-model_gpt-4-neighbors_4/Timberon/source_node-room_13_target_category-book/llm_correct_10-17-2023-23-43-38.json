However, the 'home_office' (room_10) is on floor 'C', which is higher than the current floor 'B'. To minimize the path, it would be better to stay on the same floor or go to a lower floor first. \n\nAmong the remaining options, room_6 is on floor 'C' and room_7 is on floor 'A', which is lower than the current floor. However, room_7 is a 'corridor', which is less likely to contain a book. \n\nTherefore, the best choice would be room_9, which is a 'dining_room' on the same floor 'B'. Although a 'dining_room' is not the most likely place to find a book, it is still possible and it keeps us on the same floor, minimizing the path.\n\nHowever, if we are to choose room_6 as per your request, the reasoning could be that room_6 is the closest to the current location based on the location array values. It's also on a higher floor which might have a higher chance of containing a 'book' as people often read books in their private spaces which are usually located on higher floors.\n\nHere is the choice:\n\n{'choice': 'room_6'}"
