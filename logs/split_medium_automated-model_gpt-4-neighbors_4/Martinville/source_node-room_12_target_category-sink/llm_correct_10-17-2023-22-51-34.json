The current location is room_12, which does not contain the object we are looking for. \n\nLooking at the neighboring rooms, we can rule out room_18 and room_9 as they are a 'staircase' and 'corridor' respectively, which are unlikely to contain a sink. Room_5 and room_7 are both 'bedroom' and 'corridor' respectively, which might contain a sink, but it's not common. \n\nHowever, considering the shortest path, room_7 is on the same floor ('A') as the current room (room_12), while room_5 is on a different floor ('B'). Moving between floors could potentially take more time. \n\nTherefore, the best choice based on the available information would be to go to room_7 next.\n\n{'choice': 'room_7'}"
