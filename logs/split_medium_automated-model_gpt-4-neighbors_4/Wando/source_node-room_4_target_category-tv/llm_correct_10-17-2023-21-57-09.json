        "content": "Looking at the information provided, we can make a few assumptions. \n\nFirstly, the 'tv' object we are looking for is more likely to be found in a 'bedroom' or a 'living room' than in a 'closet' or a 'corridor'. This is because TVs are typically found in these types of rooms. \n\nSecondly, larger rooms are more likely to contain a TV than smaller rooms. This is because larger rooms typically have more objects in them.\n\nGiven these assumptions, 'room_3' seems to be the best choice. It is a 'bedroom', which is a likely place to find a TV, and it is also the largest room out of the options, making it more likely to contain a TV.\n\nTherefore, the choice should be 'room_3'.\n\n{'choice': 'room_3'}"
