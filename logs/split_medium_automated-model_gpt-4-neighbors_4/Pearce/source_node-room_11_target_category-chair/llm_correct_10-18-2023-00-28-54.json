The goal is to find a 'chair' in the shortest path possible. \n\nLooking at the neighboring rooms, room_25 and room_26 are on the same floor 'A' as the current room, while room_15 is on a different floor 'B'. Since changing floors might take extra time, it's more efficient to stay on the same floor if possible.\n\nBetween room_25 and room_26, room_25 is a 'staircase' and room_26 is a 'storage'. Chairs are more likely to be found in a 'storage' room than in a 'staircase'. \n\nTherefore, the best choice would be room_26.\n\n{'choice': 'room_26'}"
