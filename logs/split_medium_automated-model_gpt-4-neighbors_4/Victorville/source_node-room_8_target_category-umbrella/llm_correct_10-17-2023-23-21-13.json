Umbrellas are typically stored near entrances or in utility rooms for easy access when leaving the building. \n\n2. The current room is a closet, which is not a typical place to store an umbrella.\n\n3. Among the neighboring rooms, room_19 is a utility room, which could potentially store an umbrella. However, it's on the same floor ('C') as the current room, which is not near an entrance.\n\n4. Room_5 is a bedroom and room_13 is a home office. These are less likely places to store an umbrella.\n\n5. Room_2 is a bathroom, which is also not a typical place to store an umbrella. However, it's on a different floor ('B'), which could be closer to an entrance.\n\nGiven these assumptions, none of the options are ideal. However, room_2 could potentially be closer to an entrance, which is a likely place to find an umbrella. Therefore, it might be the best choice among the given options.\n\n{'choice': 'room_2'}"
