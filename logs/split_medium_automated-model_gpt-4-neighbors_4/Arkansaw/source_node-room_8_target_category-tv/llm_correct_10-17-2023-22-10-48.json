Since the type of room can give us a clue about the presence of a TV, we can rule out 'room_17' and 'room_18' as they are 'staircase' rooms where a TV is unlikely to be found. \n\nBetween 'room_7' and 'room_13', 'room_13' is a 'kitchen' where a TV is also less likely to be found. 'Room_7' is a 'corridor' which also has a low likelihood of having a TV. \n\nHowever, the task is to find the shortest path possible. In this case, 'room_18' is the closest to the current location 'room_8' based on the location coordinates provided. \n\nTherefore, even though 'room_18' is a 'staircase' and less likely to have a TV, it should be the next room to visit because it provides the shortest path.\n\n{'choice': 'room_18'}"
