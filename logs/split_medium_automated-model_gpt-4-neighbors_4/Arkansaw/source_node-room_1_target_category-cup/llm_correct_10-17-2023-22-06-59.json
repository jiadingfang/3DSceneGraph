The objects in this room are a toilet and a sink, neither of which are cups. Therefore, it is necessary to move to a different room.\n\nLooking at the neighboring rooms, room_2 is a bathroom, room_7 is a corridor, room_13 is a kitchen, and room_17 is a staircase. Cups are most likely to be found in a kitchen, but room_13 is on a different floor (floor B), which may require more time to reach. \n\nRoom_2, although also a bathroom, is on floor B, closer to the kitchen (room_13). Moving to room_2 could potentially provide a shorter path to the kitchen, increasing the chances of finding a cup more quickly. \n\nTherefore, the next place to go should be room_2.\n\n{'choice': 'room_2'}"
