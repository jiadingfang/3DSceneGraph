The current location is room_12, and the neighbors are room_14, room_13, room_15, room_11, object_5, and object_31. \n\nLooking at the neighbors, object_5 and object_31 are not suitcases, so they can be eliminated from the choices. \n\nNow, we have room_14, room_13, room_15, and room_11 left. Room_14 and room_13 are both on the 'B' floor, while room_15 is on the 'C' floor and room_11 is on the 'A' floor. Since we don't have any information about where the suitcase might be, it's reasonable to stay on the same floor for now to minimize the path. \n\nBetween room_14 and room_13, room_13 has a slightly larger floor area, which might increase the chance of finding a suitcase. Therefore, the choice should be room_13.\n\n{'choice': 'room_13'}"
