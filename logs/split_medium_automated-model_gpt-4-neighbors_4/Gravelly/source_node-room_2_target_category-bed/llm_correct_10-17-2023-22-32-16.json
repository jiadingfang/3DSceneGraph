The 'bed' object is more likely to be found in a room rather than a utility room, a bathroom, a staircase, or a corridor. However, all the available options are not typical rooms where a bed would be found.\n\n2. We have already visited 'room_2', so it would not be efficient to revisit it.\n\n3. 'room_30' is a utility room, which is less likely to contain a bed.\n\n4. 'room_29' is a staircase, which is highly unlikely to contain a bed.\n\n5. 'room_13' is a corridor, which is also unlikely to contain a bed, but it might lead to other rooms that could contain a bed.\n\nGiven these assumptions, 'room_13' seems to be the best choice as it might lead us to other rooms where a bed could be found. \n\n{'choice': 'room_13'}"
