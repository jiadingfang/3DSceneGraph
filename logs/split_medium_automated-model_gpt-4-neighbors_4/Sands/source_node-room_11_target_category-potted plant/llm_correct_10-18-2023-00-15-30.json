Therefore, we need to move to a different room. \n\nLooking at the neighboring rooms, room_2 is a good choice for several reasons:\n\n1. Proximity: Room_2 is one of the closest rooms to the current location, which means it will take less time to reach compared to some other rooms.\n\n2. Size: Room_2 has a larger floor area compared to room_3. This means it potentially contains more objects, increasing the chances of finding a 'potted plant'.\n\n3. Scene Category: Room_2 is a bathroom. While it's not the most common place to find a potted plant, it's not uncommon to find plants in bathrooms for decorative purposes.\n\nTherefore, considering the proximity, size, and scene category, room_2 seems to be a reasonable choice to explore next.\n\n{'choice': 'room_2'}"
