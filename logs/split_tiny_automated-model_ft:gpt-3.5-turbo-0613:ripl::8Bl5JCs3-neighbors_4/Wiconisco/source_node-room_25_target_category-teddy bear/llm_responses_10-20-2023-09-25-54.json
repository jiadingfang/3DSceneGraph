So, we can remove them from our options. \n\nNow, we are left with 'room_4'. Since we don't have any information about the objects in each room, we can't make a decision based on that. However, we can consider the 'scene_category' of each room. \n\n'room_4' is a bathroom, which is less likely to contain a 'teddy bear' compared to other types of rooms. \n\nTherefore, based on the available information, the best choice would be to go to 'room_4' next.\n\n{'choice': 'room_4'}"
