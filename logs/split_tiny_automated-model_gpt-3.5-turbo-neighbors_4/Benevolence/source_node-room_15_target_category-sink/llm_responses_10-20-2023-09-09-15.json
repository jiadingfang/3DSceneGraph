        "content": "Based on the information provided, I would suggest going to 'room_7' next. \n\nHere is my reasoning:\n1. The current place is 'room_15', and we are looking for an object in the category 'sink'. Since there is no information about the presence of a sink in 'room_15', we need to explore other rooms.\n2. Among the available neighbors, 'room_8', 'room_7', 'room_16', and 'room_14', 'room_7' seems to be the most promising choice.\n3. The information about 'room_7' indicates that it is a corridor, which is a common area where sinks are usually located.\n4. Additionally, 'room_7' has a larger floor area compared to 'room_8' and 'room_16', which increases the likelihood of finding a sink.\n5. Therefore, choosing 'room_7' as the next place to go increases the chances of finding a sink.\n\nThe chosen neighbor is 'room_7'."
