Among the available neighbors, 'room_3' seems to be the most relevant choice as it is also a bathroom, similar to the current room.\n3. Since chairs are commonly found in bathrooms, there is a higher probability of finding a chair in 'room_3' compared to other rooms.\n4. Therefore, going to 'room_3' would increase the chances of finding a chair.\n\nThe chosen neighbor is 'room_3'."
