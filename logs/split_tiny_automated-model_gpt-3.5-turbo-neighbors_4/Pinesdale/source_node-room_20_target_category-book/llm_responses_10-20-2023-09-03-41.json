Since there is no information about any objects in room_20, it is better to explore the neighboring rooms.\n2. Among the available neighbors, room_10 seems like a good choice because it is a corridor. Corridors often have bookshelves or other storage areas where books might be found.\n3. Additionally, room_10 has a smaller floor area compared to the other neighbors, which means it might be easier to search and navigate through.\n4. Therefore, I recommend going to room_10 next.\n\nThe chosen neighbor is room_10."
