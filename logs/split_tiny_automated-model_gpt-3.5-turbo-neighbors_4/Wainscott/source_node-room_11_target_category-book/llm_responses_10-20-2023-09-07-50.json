The current place is room_11, and we are looking for an object in the category 'book'.\n2. Among the available neighbors, room_21 is categorized as a 'staircase', room_14 is an 'exercise_room', and room_1 is a 'bathroom'. None of these rooms are likely to have a book.\n3. On the other hand, room_10 is categorized as a 'corridor', which is a more likely place to find a book.\n4. Therefore, it is reasonable to choose room_10 as the next place to go.\n\nThe chosen neighbor is room_10."
