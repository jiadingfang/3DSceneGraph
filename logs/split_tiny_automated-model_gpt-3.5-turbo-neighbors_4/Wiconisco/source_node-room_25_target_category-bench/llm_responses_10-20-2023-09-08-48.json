The current place is room_25, which is a room located on floor B with a scene category of \"staircase\".\n2. Among the available neighbors, room_11 is the closest neighbor to room_25.\n3. Room_11 is a room located on floor B with a scene category of \"corridor\".\n4. Since we are looking for a bench, it is more likely to find one in a corridor rather than a staircase.\n5. Therefore, it is reasonable to choose room_11 as the next place to go.\n\nThe chosen neighbor is room_11."
