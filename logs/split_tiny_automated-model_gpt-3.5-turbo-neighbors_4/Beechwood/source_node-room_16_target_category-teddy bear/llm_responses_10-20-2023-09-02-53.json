The current place is room_16, and the task is to find a teddy bear object with the shortest path possible.\n2. Among the available neighbors (room_9, room_8, room_7, room_14), room_9 seems to be the most relevant choice.\n3. Room_9 is categorized as a corridor, which is more likely to have objects like teddy bears compared to a closet (room_7) or a lobby (room_14).\n4. Additionally, room_9 has a larger floor area compared to room_8, which might increase the chances of finding the desired object.\n5. Therefore, choosing room_9 as the next destination seems like a reasonable choice.\n\nThe chosen neighbor is room_9."
