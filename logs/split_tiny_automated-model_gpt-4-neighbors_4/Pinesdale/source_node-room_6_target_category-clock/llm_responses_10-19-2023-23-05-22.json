        "content": "First, let's eliminate the rooms that we have already visited to avoid unnecessary backtracking. In this case, we have already visited 'room_20', so we can remove it from our options. \n\nNext, we should consider the 'floor_number' of the rooms. Since there is no information about the location of the 'clock', we can assume that it could be on any floor. However, to minimize the path, it would be better to explore all the rooms on the current floor before moving to another floor. In this case, 'room_22' is on the same floor 'A' as the current room 'room_10', while 'room_12' and 'room_8' are on a different floor 'B'. So, we should prioritize 'room_22'.\n\nFinally, we should consider the 'scene_category' of the rooms. Some categories like 'utility_room' or 'bedroom' are more likely to contain a 'clock' than others like 'corridor' or 'staircase'. In this case, 'room_22' is a 'utility_room' and 'room_8' is a 'bedroom', both of which could potentially contain a 'clock'. However, since 'room_22' is on the same floor as the current room, it should be our first choice.\n\nTherefore, the next room to visit should be 'room_22'.\n\n{'choice': 'room_22'}"
